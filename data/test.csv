fully converting graphite into graphene oxide hydrogels by preoxidation with impure manganese dioxide potassium permanganate (kmno4) has been proved to be an efficient oxidant for converting graphite into graphite oxide but its slow diffusion in the interlayer of graphite seriously restricts the production of graphene oxide (go) here we demonstrate that the preoxidation of graphite by impure manganese dioxide (mno2) in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid (h2so4) and phosphorus pentoxide (p2o5) can efficiently improve the synthesis of go when kmno4 is employed as the oxidant the prepared honey like go hydrogels possess a high yield of single layer sheets large sizes (average lateral size up to 20 mu m) wide ranges of stable dispersion concentrations (from dilute solutions viscous hydrogels to dry films) and good conductivity after reduction (similar to 2 9 x 10(4) s m) the mechanism for the improved synthesis of go by impure mno2 was explored the enhanced exfoliation and oxidation of graphite by oxidative mn ions (mainly mn3 ) which are synergistically produced by the reaction of impure mno2 with h2so4 and p2o5 are found to be responsible for the improved synthesis of such go hydrogels particularly preoxidized graphite (pog) can be partially dispersed in water with sonication which allows the facile construction of flexible and highly conductive graphene nanosheet film electrodes with excellent electrochemical sensing properties ,1

the medicinal thiosulfinates from garlic and petiveria are not radical trapping antioxidants in liposomes and cells but lipophilic analogs are the radical trapping antioxidant (rta) activities of allicin and petivericin thiosulfinates widely believed responsible for the medicinal properties of garlic and petiveria were determined in phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers the results indicate that both compounds are surprisingly ineffective in sharp contrast with previous studies in organic solution which showed that they undergo facile cope elimination to produce sulfenic acids potent radical trapping agents in an effort to understand the medium dependence of this activity a more lipophilic (hexylated) analog of petivericin was synthesized and shown to be among the most effective rtas known but only in the presence of a hydrophilic thiol (e g n acetylcysteine) additional symmetric and unsymmetric thiosulfinates were synthesized to shed light on the structural features that underlie this reactivity these studies reveal that amphiphilic thiosulfinates which undergo s thiolation with a hydrophilic thiol to give lipophilic sulfenic acids are required and that an activated methylene group key to promote cope elimination is not interestingly the added thiol was also found to regenerate the sulfenic acid following its reaction with peroxyl radicals this activity was diminished at more acidic ph suggesting that it occurs by electron transfer from the thiolate allicin petivericin and hexylated petivericin were assayed as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation in human tf1a erythroblasts and hek 293 kidney cells revealing similar efficacies in the low mu m range the same range in which allicin and petivericin were found to induce cell death concomitant with or as a result of glutathione (gsh) depletion in contrast hexylated petivericin was not cytotoxic throughout the concentration range assayed and had no effect on gsh levels taken together the results in lipid bilayers and in cell culture suggest that the greater lipophilicity of hexylated petivericin enables it to partition to membranous cell compartments where it forms a lipid soluble sulfenic acid that traps peroxyl radicals whereas allicin and petivericin partition to the cytosol where they deplete gsh and induce cell death ,0

excess surface energy at the tips of gold nanospikes from experiment to modeling physicochemical aspects of anisotropic gold nanostructures have been of considerable interest due to intrinsic shape dependent phenomena that open up newer perspectives from nanoscale electromagnetism to basic thermodynamics since gold has a highly symmetric face centered cubic (fcc) structure and usually tends to afford a spherical geometry to reduce surface free energy the emergence of novel properties of these anisotropic structures could be attributed to the lack of symmetry at the interface or to the confinement of electrons that does not scale linearly with size based on these concepts anisotropic gold nanospike has been chosen as a typical nanostructural system that possesses different surface energy around the nanostructure in comparison to isotropic gold nanosphere to quantify the precise surface energy at the tips of these intricate nanostructures cetyltrimethylammonium bromide stabilized gold nanospheres and nanospikes have been synthesized in aqueous medium under ambient conditions since fluorescence spectroscopy is a very sensitive technique fluorescent dye alizarin red has been employed as a local probe to elucidate the detailed spectral characteristics of the metalprobe hybrid assemblies the influence of morphological anisotropy of these nanostructures has been further emphasized by following the temporal changes in the emission characteristics during the photoinduced conversion of gold nanospikes to nanospheres under nir laser irradiation experimental realization of excess surface energy at the tips of the nanospikes has been calculated from theoretical perspectives ,1
"cell in shell hybrids chemical nanoencapsulation of individual cells conspectus nature has developed a fascinating strategy of cryptobiosis (""secret life"") for counteracting the stressful and often lethal environmental conditions that fluctuate sporadically over time for example certain bacteria sporulate to transform from a metabolically active vegetative state to an ametabolic endospore state the bacterial endospores encased within tough biomolecular shells withstand the extremes of harmful stressors such as radiation desiccation and malnutrition for extended periods of time and return to a vegetative state by breaking their protective shells apart when their environment becomes hospitable for living certain ciliates and even higher organisms for example tardigrades and others are also found to adopt a cryptobiotic strategy for survival a common feature of cryptobiosis is the structural presence of tough sheaths on cellular structures however most cells and cellular assemblies are not ""spore forming"" and are vulnerable to the outside threats in particular mammalian cells enclosed with labile lipid bilayers are highly susceptible to in vitro conditions in the laboratory and daily life settings making manipulation and preservation difficult outside of specialized conditions the instability of living cells has been a main bottleneck to the advanced development of cell based applications such as cell therapy and cell based sensors a judicious question arises can cellular tolerance against harmful stresses be enhanced by simply forming cell in shell hybrid structures? experimental results suggest that the answer is yes a micrometer sized ""iron man"" can be generated by chemically forming an ultrathin ( 100 nm) but durable shell on a ""non spore forming"" cell since the report on silica nanoencapsulation of yeast cells in which cytoprotective yeast in silica hybrids were formed several synthetic strategies have been developed to encapsulate individual cells in a cytocompatible fashion mimicking the cryptobiotic cell in shell structures found in nature for example bacterial endospores bioinspired silicification and phenolics based coatings are so far the main approaches to the formation of cytoprotective cell in shell hybrids because they ensure cell viability during encapsulations and also generate durable nanoshells on cell surfaces the resulting cell in shell hybrids extrinsically possess enhanced resistance to external aggressors and more intriguingly the encapsulation alters their metabolic activity exemplified by retarded or suppressed cell cycle progression in addition recent developments in the field have further advanced the synthetic tools available to the stage of chemical sporulation and germination of mammalian cells where cytoprotective shells are formed on labile mammalian cells and broken apart on demand for example individual hela cells are coated with a metal organic complex of ferric ion and tannic acid and cellular adherence and proliferation are controlled by the programmed shell formation and degradation based on these demonstrations the (degradable) cell in shell hybrids are anticipated to find their applications in various biomedical and bionanotechnological areas such as cytotherapeutics high throughput screening sensors and biocatalysis as well as providing a versatile research platform for single cell biology ",0

well wrapped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets on nb3o7(oh) nanostructures as good electron collectors and transporters for efficient photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b and phenol graphene based nanocomposites have attracted considerable attention in photocatalytic research owing to their remarkable potential for the photodegradation of environmental pollutants however despite the progress made in this field the development of visible light active photocatalysts with high activity and durability remains a challenge in this work bunches of nb3o7(oh) nanorods wrapped in reduced graphene oxide (rgo) nanosheets were prepared by using a hydrothermal method the photocatalytic activity of the as synthesized nb3o7(oh) rgo nanocomposites was significantly enhanced compared to that of the pure nb3o7(oh) nanostructures owing to their improved visible light absorption and separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs photoluminescence studies strongly supported the proposed charge separation and charge transport mechanism moreover the photocatalytic efficiency was strongly dependent on the concentration of rgo in the nanocomposites the highest photodegradation rate was obtained using the nanocomposite prepared with a graphene loading of 3 mg ml( 1) and when the rgo loading exceeded 3 mg ml( 1) the photodegradation efficiency decreased this occurred because excess rgo nanosheets aggregated and hindered the absorption of incident light we believe that this work provides invaluable information for the design of new efficient visible light active reduced graphene oxide based photocatalysts to be used in water remediation through the oxidative degradation of organic dyes and toxic phenols ,0

tailoring the textural properties of hierarchical porous carbons using deep eutectic solvents soft template approaches have been frequently applied for the preparation of porous carbons most of these processes proved highly effective for the preparation of mesoporous carbons with pore diameters below 10 nm but less explored has been the preparation of carbons with mesopores larger than 10 nm the lack of syntheses providing large and well interconnected mesopores is by no means a trivial issue because it limits the achievement of materials suitable for applications where pore surface accessibility is crucial e g electrodes in supercapacitors or adsorbents in flow through systems among others in this work we have used deep eutectic solvents (dess a sort of ionic liquid that are obtained by complexation of quaternary ammonium salts with hydrogen bond donors) composed of resorcinol urea and choline chloride for the preparation via formaldehyde polycondensation and subsequent carbonization of hierarchical porous carbons with micropores and large mesopores within the 10 to 20 nm range the formation of large mesopores took place at the polycondensation stage via a spinodal decomposition process where some components forming the des acted as precursors of the polymer phase while some other ones were segregated into a polymer depleted phase thus the ultimate dimension of the mesopores was controlled by the mass ratio between the segregated and condensed phases and this mass ratio by the molar ratio of the components forming the original des we have finally demonstrated that carbons with larger mesopores exhibited better performance as electrodes in supercapacitor cells ,1

quasi guiding modes in microfibers on a high refractive index substrate light confinement and amplification in micro and nanofibers have been intensively studied and a number of applications have been developed however typical micro and nanofibers are usually free standing or positioned on a substrate with lower refractive index to ensure the light confinement and guiding mode here we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the possibility of confining light within a microfiber on a high refractive index substrate in contrast to the strong leakage to the substrate we found that the radiation loss was dependent on the radius of the microfiber and the refractive index contrast consequently quasi guiding modes could be formed and the light could propagate and be amplified in such systems by fabricating a tapered silica fiber and dye doped polymer fiber and placing them on sapphire substrates the light propagation amplification and consequent laser behaviors have been experimentally studied to verify the quasi guiding modes in a microfiber on a higher index substrate we believe that our research will be essential for the applications of microfibers and on chip photonic circuits ,1

explosive versus thermite behavior in iron(0) aerogels infiltrated with perchlorates monolithic nanoporous iron was prepared via carbothermal reduction of interpenetrating networks of polybenzoxazine and iron oxide nanoparticles excess carbon was burned off at 600 degrees c in air and oxides produced from partial oxidation of the fe(0) network were reduced back to fe(0) with h 2 at different temperatures (temp) ranging from 300 to 1300 degrees c samples were carbon free for temp 400 degrees c also oxide free and are referred to according to the final h 2 reduction temperature as fe temp fe temp monoliths were infiltrated with perchlorates dried exhaustively and were ignited with a flame in open air most experimentation was conducted with liclo4 depending on temp monoliths fizzled out ( 400 degrees c) exploded violently (500 900 degrees c) or behaved as thermites ( 950 degrees c) samples sealed in evacuated tubes did not explode while if sealed under n 2 the explosive effect was intensified thus explosive behavior was attributed to rapid heating and expansion of gas filling nanoporous space however although that condition was necessary for explosive behavior it was not sufficient based on sem particle sizes via n 2 sorption electrical conductivity measurements and mechanical strength data under quasi static compression it was concluded that the boundaries between the three types of behavior after ignition were associated with (a) mild sintering (fizzling explosive boundary at around 500 degrees c) and (b) melting like fusion of skeletal nanoparticles (explosive thermite boundary at around 950 degrees c) overall mechanically weaker networks fizzled out too strong behaved as thermites networks of intermediate strength exploded for thermite behavior in particular other factors may be also at play such as a combination of reduced porosity a substoichiometric ambunt of liclo4 and a slower heat release rate the latter was supported by tga data in o 2 and was attributed to a slower rate of oxidation of progressively thicker nanostructures as the h 2 reduction temperature increased ,1

light directed self assembly of robust alginate gels at precise locations in microfluidic channels recently there has been much interest in using light to activate self assembly of molecules in a fluid leading to gelation the advantage of light over other stimuli lies in its spatial selectivity i e its ability to be directed at a precise location which could be particularly useful in microfluidic applications however existing light responsive fluids are not suitable for these purposes since they do not convert into sufficiently strong gels that can withstand shear here we address this deficiency by developing a new light responsive system based on the well known polysaccharide alginate the fluid is composed entirely of commercially available components alginate a photoacid generator (pag) and a chelated complex of divalent strontium (sr2 ) cations upon exposure to ultraviolet (uv) light the pag dissociates to release h ions which in turn induce the release of free sr2 from the chelate the sr2 ions self assemble with the alginate chains to give a stiff gel with an elastic modulus similar to 2000 pa and a yield stress similar to 400 pa (this gel is strong enough to be picked up and held by one's fingers) the above fluid is sent through a network of microchannels and a short segment of a specific channel is exposed to uv light at that point the fluid is locally transformed into a strong gel in a few minutes and the resulting gel blocks the flow through that channel while other channels remain open when the uv light is removed the gel is gradually diluted by the flow and the channel reopens we have thus demonstrated a remote controlled fluidic valve that can be closed by shining light and reopened when the light is removed in addition we also show that light induced gelation of our alginate fluid can be used to deposit biocompatible payloads at specific addresses within a microchannel ,1

"effect of meso and micro porosity in carbon electrodes on atomic layer deposition of pseudocapacitive v2o5 for high performance supercapacitors atomic layer deposition (ald) of vanadium oxide is a viable means to add pseudocapacitive layers to porous carbon electrodes two commercial activated carbon materials with different surface areas and pore structures were acid treated and coated by v2o5 ald using vanadium triisopropoxide and water at 150 degrees c the v2o5 ald process was characterized at various temperatures to confirm saturated ald growth conditions capacitance and electrochemical impedance analysis of subsequently constructed electrochemical capacitors (ecs) showed improved charge storage for the ald coated electrodes but the extent of improvement depended on initial pore structure the ald of v2o5 onto mesoporous carbon increased the capacitance by up to 46 after 75 ald cycles and obtained a maximum pseudocapacitance of 540 f g(v2o5) after 25 ald cycles while maintaining low electrical resistance high columbic efficiency and a high cycle life however adding v2o5 ald to microporous carbons with pore diameters of 11 angstrom showed far less improvement likely due to ""blocking off"" of the micropores and reducing the accessible surface area results show that ald is a viable means to construct high performance supercapacitors from activated carbon which is the basis for commercial products and a clear understanding of carbon electrode pore structure layer conformality and layer thickness are necessary to fully optimize performance ",1

enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption properties of poly(3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene) nanofiber decorated graphene sheets by non covalent interactions graphene sheets (gns) have high conductivity but they exhibit weak electromagnetic (em) wave absorption performance here poly (3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (pedot) nanofibers were decorated on the surface of gns in which the residual defects and groups act as the active sites and therefore are beneficial for the deposition of pedot nanofibers the sem images display that pedot nanofibers are successfully decorated on the surface of gns through in situ polymerization the diameter of the pedot nanofibers were ranged from 15 to 50 nm with hundreds of nanometers in length the em wave absorption properties of graphene pedot and gns pedot were also investigated compared to pure graphene and pedot the em wave absorption properties of gns pedot improved significantly the maximum value of r (l) was up to 48 1 db at 10 5 ghz with a thickness of only 2 mm meanwhile the absorption bandwidth of r (l) values below 10 db was 9 4 ghz (5 8 12 3 12 9 15 8 ghz) in the thickness of 1 5 3 mm the enhancement is attributed to the modification of pedot and the unique structure of nanofibers on one hand the deposition of pedot nanofibers on the surface of gns decreases the conductivity of graphene and makes impedance match better on the other hand the unique structure of pedot nanofibers results in relatively large specific surfaces areas providing more active sites for reflection and scattering of em waves therefore our findings demonstrate that the deposition of conducting polymers on gns by non covalent bond is an efficient way to fabricate strong em wave absorbers ,1

building self healing alloy architecture for stable sodium ion battery anodes a case study of tin anode materials the rational design of anode materials is a challenge in developing sodium ion batteries alloy anodes provide high gravimetric and volumetric capacities but suffer the short cycle life as a result of the continuous and accumulated pulverization resulting from a large volume change during the cycling process herein using pure sn an irreversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (sno) and a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (sn4p3) as samples we demonstrate that the pulverization and aggregation of the alloy anode can be partially recovered and the accumulation of pulverization and aggregation during charge discharge cycles can be terminated using a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction the cycling stability of three sn based anodes increases in order of sn4p3 sno sn the enhancement in sn4p3 can be attributed to a reversible reaction of sn4p3 9na 4sn 3na(3)p which repairs the cracks damage and aggregation of sn particles that occurred in the alloy process of 4sn 15na na15sn4 during cycling and hence terminates the pulverization the repair mechanism looks like the self healing feature in nature where the damage can be healed by itself therefore the suggested mechanism can be called self healing while the repaired anode can be termed as the self healing anode the use of self healing strategies to build an electrode architecture is new and highly desirable because it can increase the cycle life and provide a general approach toward stable electrode materials ,1

a stable lipid tio2 interface with headgroup inversed phosphocholine and a comparison with sio2 zwitterionic phosphocholine (pc) lipids are highly biocompatible representing a major component of the cell membrane a simple mixing of pc liposomes and silica (sio2) surface results in liposome fusion with the surface and formation of supported lipid bilayers however the stability of this bilayer is relatively low because adsorption is based mainly on weak van der waals force pc lipids strongly adsorb by tio2 via chemical bonding with the lipid phosphate the lack of fusion on tio2 is attributable to the steric effect from the choline group in pc in this study inverse phosphocholine lipids (cp) are used directly exposing the phosphate using a calcein leakage assay and cryo tem fusion of cp liposome with tio2 is demonstrated the stability of this supported bilayer is significantly higher than that of the pc sio2 system as indicated by washing the membrane under harsh conditions adsorption of cp liposomes by tio2 is inhibited at high ph interestingly the cp liposome cannot fuse with silica surface because of a strong charge repulsion this study demonstrates an interesting interplay between a soft matter surface and metal oxides by tuning the lipid structure it is possible to rationally control the interaction force this study provides an alternative system for forming stable supported bilayers on tio2 and represents the first example of interfacing inverse lipids with inorganic surfaces ,0
preparation of antibacterial softwood via chemical attachment of quaternary ammonium compounds using supercritical co2 conversion of inexpensive and abundant softwood into useful construction materials is of significant economic and environmental importance the currently available methods for wood treatment are not sufficiently effective to overcome the drawbacks of softwood including warping and biodeterioration in the present research a novel process was developed to address these challenges by chemically attaching antibacterial quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs) to hemlock using supercritical carbon dioxide (scco(2)) nine qacs containing at least one hydroxyl group were synthesized and characterized by 1d and 2d nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (atr ftir) and high resolution mass spectroscopy (hrms) the antibacterial activity of these qacs were screened against the representative bacteria escherichia coli revealing that the antibacterial activity is dependent on the qac molecular structure two qacs that demonstrated strong antibacterial activity were selected and chemically attached to hemlock by using hexamethylene diisocyanate (hdi) as a linker via a carbamate urethane linkage in scco(2) the chemically modified hemlock demonstrated exceptional antibacterial activity and improved dimensional stability suggesting potential application of this route in the conversion of softwood into advanced durable decking and fencing materials ,0

selective and vertical microfabrication of lipid tubule arrays on glass substrates using template guided gentle hydration generally asymmetric tubular lipid structures have been formed under the specific condition of gentle hydration or by using hydrodynamic and or electrical elongation of vesicular lipid structures small size lipid tubes are however very difficult to allocate or align in the vertical direction on the specific site of the substrate and therefore the ability to produce them selectively and in large quantities as an array form is limited herein we propose an easy and novel method to fabricate selective and vertical lipid tube arrays using template guided gentle hydration of dried lipid films without any external forces a lipid solution was drop dispensed onto a porous membrane and dried to form a lipid film then the lipid coated porous membrane was transferred to a glass substrate by using a uv cured polymer layer to achieve tight bonding upon swelling with an appropriate buffer expansion forces due to osmotic pressure during the gentle hydration process were highly constrained to confined pores thereby resulting in the nucleation of tube like lipid structures through the pores interestingly according to the aspect ratio of pores (ar(pore) pore length pore diameter) different shapes of lipid structures including vesicular oval and tube like were generated which indicates the importance of the arpore as well as the pore diameter during fabrication of tubular lipid structures also this approach was easily modified with 1 chitosan to enhance the stability of the lipid tubes ( 30 min in life time) by lipid coating twice and by using unsaturated lipids to increase tube length ( 30 mu m in length) therefore in the future the simple but robust template guided gentle hydration method will be a useful tool for fabricating addressable and engineered lipid tube arrays as a sensory unit ,0

stretching induced ion complexation in physical polyampholyte hydrogels recently we have developed a series of charge balanced polyampholyte (pa) physical hydrogels by random copolymerization in water which show extraordinarily high toughness self healing ability and viscoelasticity the excellent performance of pa hydrogels is ascribed to dynamic ionic bond formation through inter and intra chain interactions the randomness results in ionic bonds of wide strength distribution the strong bonds which serve as permanent crosslinking imparting the elasticity while the weak bonds reversibly break and re form dissipating energy in this work we developed a simple physical method called a pre stretching method to promote the performance of pa hydrogels by imposing a pre stretching on the sample in the as prepared state ion complexation during dialysis is prominently accelerated and the final performance is largely promoted further analysis suggests that the strong bond formation induced by pre stretching is responsible for the change in final performance pre stretching decreases the entropy of the system and increases the chain alignment resulting in an increased possibility for strong bond formation ,1

using a patterned grating structure to create lipid bilayer platforms insensitive to air bubbles supported lipid bilayers (slbs) have been used for various biosensing applications the bilayer structure enables embedded lipid membrane species to maintain their native orientation and the two dimensional fluidity is crucial for numerous biomolecular interactions to occur the platform integrated with a microfluidic device for reagent transport and exchange has great potential to be applied with surface analytical tools however slbs can easily be destroyed by air bubbles during assay reagent transport and exchange here we created a patterned obstacle grating structured surface in a microfluidic channel to protect slbs from being destroyed by air bubbles unlike all of the previous approaches using chemical modification or adding protection layers to strengthen lipid bilayers the uniqueness of this approach is that it uses the patterned obstacles to physically trap water above the bilayers to prevent the air water interface from directly coming into contact with and peeling the bilayers we showed that our platform with certain grating geometry criteria can provide promising protection to slbs from air bubbles the required obstacle distance was found to decrease when we increased the air bubble movement speed in addition the interaction assay results from streptavidin and biotinylated lipids in the confined slbs suggested that receptors at the slbs retained the interaction ability after air bubble treatment the results showed that the developed slb platform can preserve both high membrane fluidity and high accessibility to the outside environment which have never been simultaneously achieved before incorporating the built platforms with some surface analytical tools could open the bottleneck of building highly robust in vitro cell membrane related bioassays ,0
investigation into efficiency of a novel glycol chitosan bestatin conjugate to protect thymopoietin oligopeptides from enzymatic degradation in this study a novel glycol chitosan (gcs) bestatin conjugate was synthesized and evaluated to demonstrate its efficacy in protecting thymopoietin oligopeptides from aminopeptidase mediated degradation moreover the mechanism and relative susceptibility of three thymopoietin oligopeptides thymocartin (tp4) thymopentin (tp5) and thymotrinan (tp3) to enzymatic degradation were investigated and compared at the molecular level initial investigations indicated that formation of the gcs bestatin conjugate with a substitution degree of 7 0 (moles of bestatin per mole of glycol glucosamine unit) could significantly protect all 3 peptides from aminopeptidase mediated degradation in a concentration dependent manner the space hindrance and loss of one pair of hydrogen bonds resulting from the covalent conjugation of chitosan with bestatin did not affect the specific interaction between bestatin and aminopeptidase moreover tp4 displayed a higher degradation clearance compared with those of tp5 and tp3 under the same experimental conditions the varying levels of susceptibility of these 3 peptides to aminopeptidase (tp4 tp5 tp3) were closely related to differences in their binding energies to enzyme which mainly involved van der waals forces and electrostatic interactions as supported by the results of molecular dynamics simulations these results suggest that gcs bestatin conjugate might be useful in the delivery of thymopoietin oligopeptides by mucosal routes and that tp3 and tp5 are better alternatives to tp4 for delivery because of their robust resistance against enzymatic degradation (c) 2016 american pharmacists association (r) published by elsevier inc all rights reserved ,0

influence of plasma macronutrient levels on hepatic metabolism role of regulatory networks in homeostasis and disease states the human liver acts as a homeostatic controller for maintaining the normal levels of plasma metabolite concentrations by uptake utilization storage and synthesis of essential metabolites these hepatic functions are orchestrated through a multilevel regulation composed of metabolic signaling and transcriptional networks plasma macronutrients namely glucose amino acids and fatty acids are known to influence these regulatory mechanisms to facilitate homeostasis we composed a regulatory circuit that elicits the design principle behind the metabolic regulation in liver we have developed a detailed dynamic model for hepatic metabolism incorporating the regulatory mechanisms at signaling and transcriptional level the model was analyzed to capture the behavior of hepatic metabolic fluxes under various combinations of plasma macronutrient levels the model was used to rationalize and explain the experimental observations of metabolic dysfunctions through regulatory mechanisms we addressed the key questions such as how high carbohydrate diet increases cholesterol and why a high protein diet would reduce it how high fat and high protein diet increases gluconeogenesis leading to hyperglycemia how tca (tricarboxylic acid) cycle is impaired through diet induced insulin resistance how high fat can impair plasma ammonia balance how high plasma glucose can lead to dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease etc the analysis indicates that higher levels (above 2 5 3 fold) of macronutrient in plasma results in impairment of metabolic functions due to perturbations in the regulatory circuit while higher glucose levels saturate the rate of plasma glucose uptake higher amino acids activate glucagon and inhibit irs (insulin receptor substrate) through s6k (s6 kinase) whereas higher fatty acid levels inhibit irs through dag pkc (diacylglycerol and protein kinase c) and trb3 activation moreover the atp adp ratio is reduced under such conditions and beta oxidation is up regulated through activation of ppar alpha (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) leading to reduced anabolic capacity and increased cataplerosis in tca cycle the above factors together decrease insulin sensitivity and enhances glucagon effect through underlying signaling and transcriptional network leading to insulin resistance in liver such a metabolic state is known to result in diabetes and non alcoholic fatty liver disease ,0

ultraviolet visible interband plasmonics with p block elements we investigate the origin of the ultraviolet visible plasmonic properties of three elemental materials from the p block bi sb and ga which has not been discussed so far despite growing interest in these materials for plasmonic applications we review and analyze a broad range of optically determined dielectric functions epsilon epsilon(1) j epsilon(2) of these elemental materials available in the literature covering a wide photon energy range (from 0 03 to 24 ev) it is shown that the contribution of free carriers to epsilon(1) in the ultraviolet visible is negligible for bi and sb and small for ga in contrast the interband transitions of these elemental materials show a high oscillator strength that yields a strong negative contribution to epsilon(1) in the ultraviolet visible therefore it is proposed that in nanostructures made of these elemental materials the interband transitions induce localized surface plasmon like resonances in the ultraviolet visible it is examplified how these resonances are sensitive to the size and environment of the nanostructures furthermore ultraviolet visible plasmonic properties achieved through interband transitions without free carrier excitation are especially appealing because they might be tuned through the tailoring of the band structure and by the occupancy of electronic states therefore they are promising for the development of broadly tunable nanostructures and metamaterials (c) 2016 optical society of america ,1
amyloid beta(25 35) peptides aggregate into cross beta sheets in unsaturated anionic lipid membranes at high peptide concentrations one of the hallmarks of alzheimer's disease is the formation of protein plaques in the brain which mainly consist of amyloid beta peptides of different lengths while the role of these plaques in the pathology of the disease is not clear the mechanism behind peptide aggregation is a topic of intense research and discussion because of their simplicity synthetic membranes are promising model systems to identify the elementary processes involved we prepared unsaturated zwitterionic anionic lipid membranes made of 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl sn glycero phosphocholine (popc) and 1 2 dimyristoyl sn glycero 3 phospho l serine (dmps) at concentrations of popc 3 mol dmps containing 0 mol 3 mol 10 mol and 20 mol amyloid beta(25 35) peptides membrane embedded peptide clusters were observed at peptide concentrations of 10 and 20 mol with a typical cluster size of b11 mm cluster density increased with peptide concentration from 59 ( 3) clusters per mm(2) to 920 ( 64) clusters per mm(2) respectively while monomeric peptides take an alpha helical state when embedded in lipid bilayers at low peptide concentrations the peptides in peptide clusters were found to form cross beta sheets and showed the characteristic pattern in x ray experiments the presence of the peptides was accompanied by an elastic distortion of the bilayers which can induce a long range interaction between the peptides the experimentally observed cluster patterns agree well with monte carlo simulations of long range interacting peptides this interaction may be the fundamental process behind cross b sheet formation in membranes and these sheets may serve as seeds for further growth into amyloid fibrils ,1

how lipid membranes affect pore forming toxin activity conspectus pore forming toxins (pfts) evolved to permeate the plasma membrane of target cells this is achieved in a multistep mechanism that usually involves binding of soluble protein monomer to the lipid membrane oligomerization at the plane of the membrane and insertion of part of the polypeptide chain across the lipid membrane to form a conductive channel introduced pores allow uncontrolled transport of solutes across the membrane inflicting damage to the target cell pfts are usually studied from the perspective of structure function relationships often neglecting the important role of the bulk membrane properties on the pet mechanism of action in this account we discuss how membrane lateral heterogeneity thickness and fluidity influence the pore forming process of pfts in general lipid molecules are more accessible for binding in fluid membranes due to steric reasons when pft specifically binds ordered domains it usually recognizes a specific lipid distribution pattern like sphingomyelin (sm) clusters or sm cholesterol complexes and not individual lipid species lipid domains were also suggested to act as an additional concentration platform facilitating pft oligomerization but this is yet to be shown the last stage in pet action is the insertion of the transmembrane segment across the membranes to build the transmembrane pore walls conformational changes are a spontaneous process and sufficient free energy has to be available for efficient membrane penetration therefore fluid bilayers are permeabilized more readily in comparison to highly ordered and thicker liquid ordered lipid phase (lo) energetically more costly insertion into the lo phase can be driven by the hydrophobic mismatch between the thinner liquid disordered phase (ld) and large protein complexes which are unable to tilt like single transmembrane segments in the case of proteolipid pores membrane properties can directly modulate pore size stability and even selectivity finally events associated with pore formation can modulate properties of the lipid membrane and affect its organization model membranes do not necessarily reproduce the physicochemical properties of the native cellular membrane and caution is needed when transferring results from model to native lipid membranes in this context the utilization of novel approaches that enable studying pfts on living cells at a single molecule level should reveal complex protein lipid membrane interactions in greater detail ,0

adhesion and bending rigidity mediated wrapping of carbon nanotubes by a substrate supported cell membrane a fundamental understanding of the adhesive interaction between carbon nanotubes (cnts) and a cell membrane is essential for the design and potential applications of cnt based drug delivery systems gene carries as well as biosensors in this work we set up a theoretical model to explore the wrapping effect of a substrate supported membrane on cnts taking the deformation of cnts into consideration our results show that the competition between the membrane bending stiffness and the cnt membrane adhesion strength induces a double edged effect on the stability of a single cnt wrapped by a substrate supported membrane that is the membrane can facilitate the laying down and collapse of the cnt due to its bending rigidity while it tends to maintain the upright and open shape of the cnt as a result of the cnt membrane adhesion the phase boundary for the open and collapsed configurations due to this competition can be well described by a simple analytical model furthermore the competition can also result in the transition of the membrane between adhering to and detaching from the substrate in the system of two widely spaced cnts covered by a substrate supported cell membrane which is consistent with experimental observations ,0

structure investigation of nanohybrid pdma silica hydrogels at rest and under uniaxial deformation nano hybrid hydrogels were prepared by cross linking polymerization of n n dimethylacrylamide (dma) within a dispersion of silica nano particles working at constant polymer water ratio the mechanical properties of hydrogels can be finely tuned by changing either the level of covalent cross linker and or the amount of particles that act as physical cross linkers through specific adsorption of pdma chains whatever is the cross linking ratio (from 0 to 1 mol ) the introduction of silica nano particles dramatically improves the mechanical behavior of hydrogels with a concomitant increase of stiffness and nominal strain at failure the physical interactions being reversible in nature the dynamics of the adsorption desorption process of pdma chains directly controls the time dependence of the mechanical properties small angle neutron scattering experiments performed in contrast matching conditions show that silica particles which repel themselves at short range remain randomly dispersed during the formation of the pdma network although pdma chains readily interact with silica particles no significant variation of the polymer concentration was observed in the vicinity of silica surfaces together with the time dependence of physical interactions pointed out by mechanical analyses this result is attributed to the moderate adsorption energy of pdma chains with silica surfaces at ph 9 from 2d sans experiments it was shown that strain rapidly gives rise to a non affine deformation of the hybrid network with shearing due to the transverse compression of the particles after loading at intermediate deformation the particles recover their initial distribution due to the covalent network that is not damaged in these conditions that is no longer true at high deformation where residual anisotropy is observed ,1

"oriented circular dichroism a method to characterize membrane active peptides in oriented lipid bilayers conspectus the structures of membrane bound polypeptides are intimately related to their functions and may change dramatically with the lipid environment circular dichroism (cd) is a rapid analytical method that requires relatively low amounts of material and no labeling conventional cd is routinely used to monitor the secondary structure of peptides and proteins in solution for example in the presence of ligands and other binding partners in the case of membrane active peptides and transmembrane proteins these measurements can be applied to and remain limited to samples containing detergent micelles or small sonicated lipid vesicles such traditional cd analysis reveals only secondary structures with the help of an oriented circular dichroism (ocd) setup however based on the preparation of macroscopically oriented lipid bilayers it is possible to address the membrane alignment of a peptide in addition to its conformation this approach has been mostly used for alpha helical peptides so far but other structural elements are conceivable as well ocd analysis relies on moffitt's theory which predicts that the electronic transition dipole moments of the backbone amide bonds in helical polypeptides are polarized either parallel or perpendicular to the helix axis the interaction of the electric field vector of the circularly polarized light with these transitions results in an ocd spectrum of a membrane bound a helical peptide which exhibits a characteristic line shape and reflects the angle between ""the helix axis and the bilayer normal for parallel alignment of a peptide helix with respect to the membrane surface (s state) the corresponding ""fingerprint"" cd band around 208 nm will exhibit maximum negative amplitude if the helix changes its alignment via an obliquely tilted (t state) to a fully inserted transmembrane orientation (i state) the ellipticity at 208 nm decreases and the value approaches zero due to the decreased interactions between the field and the transition dipole compared to conventional cd ocd data are not only collected in the biologically relevant environment of a highly hydrated planar lipid bilayer (whose composition can be varied at will) but in addition it provides information about the tilt angle of the polypeptide in the membrane it is the method of choice for screening numerous different conditions such as peptide concentration lipid composition membrane additives ph temperature and sample hydration all these factors have been found to affect the peptide alignment in membrane while having little or no influence on conformation in many cases the observed realignment could be related to biological action such as pore formation by antimicrobial and cell penetrating peptides or to binding events of transmembrane segments of integral membrane proteins likewise any lipid induced conversion from alpha helix to beta sheeted conformation is readily picked up by ocd and has been interpreted in terms of protein instability or amyloidformation ",0
