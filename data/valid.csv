site specific bioconjugation of an organometallic electron mediator to an enzyme with retained photocatalytic cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity photosynthesis consists of a series of reactions catalyzed by redox enzymes to synthesize carbohydrates using solar energy in order to take the advantage of solar energy many researchers have investigated artificial photosynthesis systems mimicking the natural photosynthetic enzymatic redox reactions these redox reactions usually require cofactors which due to their high cost become a key issue when constructing an artificial photosynthesis system combining a photosensitizer and an rh based electron mediator (rhm) has been shown to photocatalytically regenerate cofactors however maintaining the high concentration of cofactors available for efficient enzymatic reactions requires a high concentration of the expensive rhm making this process cost prohibitive we hypothesized that conjugation of an electron mediator to a redox enzyme will reduce the amount of electron mediators necessary for efficient enzymatic reactions this is due to photocatalytically regenerated nad(p)h being readily available to a redox enzyme when the local nad(p)h concentration near the enzyme becomes higher however conventional random conjugation of rhm to a redox enzyme will likely lead to a substantial loss of cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity in order to avoid this issue we investigated whether bioconjugation of rhm to a permissive site of a redox enzyme retains cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity as a model system a rhm was conjugated to a redox enzyme formate dehydrogenase obtained from thiobacillus sp knk65ma (tsfdh) a rhm containing azide group was site specifically conjugated to p azidophenylalanine introduced to a permissive site of tsfdh via a bioorthogonal strain promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition and an appropriate linker the tsfdh rhm conjugate exhibited retained cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity ,0

molecular design of sulfonated hyperbranched poly(arylene oxindole)s for efficient cellulose conversion to levulinic acid this contribution is about the design and synthesis of various sulfonated hyperbranched poly(arylene oxindole)s (shpaos) with different substituents via a convenient a(2) b 3 polycondensation and subsequent sulfonation as water soluble and recyclable acid catalysts for the conversion of cellulose to levulinic acid (la) whereas their molecular weight (from 2 7 x 10(3) to 20 2 x 10(3)) acid density (from 3 4 to 4 8 mmol h per g) as well as the polymer structure viz hyperbranched or linear analogues only slightly affect the catalytic performance the presence of electron withdrawing substituents on the isatin polymer building block is key to their catalytic efficiency among all polymer catalyst designs studied the use of 5 cl shpao provided the highest la yield of almost 50 directly obtained from ball milled cellulose in aqueous medium at 165 degrees c being twice the la yield of that of unsubstituted shpaos the presence of the 5 chloro substituent substantially facilitates the hydrolysis of the glycoside bonds the close vicinity of the oxindole functionality to the sulfonic acid group seems essential to realize such high hydrolysis rates as chemical protection of the nh group or sulfonation at other positions lead to substantially lower la yields the presence of the 5 chlorine substituent also retards the glucose isomerisation rate while slightly increasing the hmf conversion rate to la as a result the catalytic reaction progresses in conditions of low concentrations of the most reactive intermediates fructose and hmf that otherwise could lead to considerable humin formation though hydrophobic interactions are usually invoked to explain such catalytic effects this contribution suggests also a significant role of the steric proximity of the sulfonic acid group to the oxindole nh group enabling a kinetic optimization of the reaction cascade through molecular design of the catalytically active acid site ,0

ws2 nanoadditized lubricant for applications affected by hydrogen embrittlement hydrogen is one of the cleanest available vehicle fuels but its small atomic size allows it to diffuse readily through the lattice of solid materials which can cause catastrophic failure in high strength steels metal embrittlement has been identified as a major consequence of hydrogen uptake and represents an extra challenge for lubricated tribological parts in fuel cell vehicles hydrogen compressors storage tanks dispensers and wind turbines that are normally subjected to high stresses this study has found ws2 nanoparticles as an effective additive candidate to impede the permeation of hydrogen into rolling element bearings at high temperatures and pressures compared to the pure polyalphaolefin (pao) base oil ws2 nanoadditized oil reduced the concentration of permeated hydrogen in the bearing steel and led to controlled wear and smoother tracks these effects are attributed to the formation of a chemical tribofilm on the wear track which reduces hydrogen embrittlement and extends the life of steel through several mechanisms (1) its continuous generation impedes formation of nascent catalytic surfaces during rubbing and thus prevents the decomposition of oil water molecules and generation of atomic hydrogen (2) acts as a physical barrier to hydrogen permeation through the wear track (3) the low coefficient of diffusion of hydrogen through the tungsten compounds found in the tribofilm further reduces hydrogen permeation (4) some of the atomic hydrogen is used up in redox reactions during the formation of the tribofilm and (5) the tribofilm reduces the total amount of water in the steel formed by the reaction of hydrogen atoms with oxides and thus extends the fatigue life ws2 nanoadditized lubricants can lead to improved profitability and sustainability of the emerging renewable energy industry ,0

reactivation from the ni b state in nife hydrogenase of ralstonia eutropha is controlled by reduction of the superoxidised proximal cluster the tolerance towards oxic conditions of o 2 tolerant nife hydrogenases has been attributed to an unusual 4fe 3s cluster that lies proximal to the nife active site upon exposure to oxygen this cluster converts to a superoxidised (5 ) state which is believed to secure the formation of the so called ni b state that is rapidly reactivated under reducing conditions here the reductive reactivation of the membrane bound nife hydrogenase (mbh) from ralstonia eutropha in a native like lipid membrane was characterised and compared to a variant that instead carries a typical 4fe 4s proximal cluster reactivation from the ni b state was faster in the 4fe 4s variant suggesting that the reactivation rate in mbh is limited by the reduction of the superoxidised 4fe 3s cluster we propose that the 4fe 3s cluster plays a major role in protecting mbh by blocking the reversal of electron transfer to the nife active site which would produce damaging radical oxygen species ,0

membrane anchor of cytochrome p450 reductase suppresses the uncoupling of cytochrome p450 cytochrome p450 reductase (cpr) is an important redox partner of microsomal cyps cpr is composed of a membrane anchor and a catalytic domain that contains fad and flavin mononucleotide (fmn) as redox centers and mediates electron transfer to cyp although the cpr membrane anchor is believed to be requisite for interaction with cyp its physiological role is still controversial to clarify the role of the anchor we constructed a mutant (delta 60 cpr) in which the n terminal membrane anchor was truncated and studied its effect on binding properties electron transfer to cyp2c19 and drug metabolism we found that delta 60 cpr could bind to and transfer electrons to cyp2c19 as efficiently as wt cpr even in the absence of lipid membrane in accordance with this delta 60 cpr could mediate metabolism of amitriptyline (amt) and imipramine (imp) in the absence of lipids although activity was diminished however delta 60 cpr failed to metabolize omeprazole (opz) and lansoprazole (lpz) to clarify the reason for this discrepancy in drug metabolism we investigated the uncoupling reaction of the cyp catalytic cycle by measuring the amount of h2o2 by product we found that shunt pathways were markedly activated in the presence of opz lpz in the delta 60 cpr mutant because h2o2 levels varied among the drugs we conclude that the proton network in the distal pocket of cyp2c19 is perturbed differently by different drugs and activated oxygen is degraded to become h2o2 therefore we propose a novel role for the membrane anchor as a suppressor of the uncoupling reaction in drug metabolism by cyp ,0

sustainable waste mitigation biotemplated nanostructured zno for photocatalytic water treatment via extraction of biofuels from hydrothermal carbonization of banana stalk working at the food energy water nexus we identified an abundant agricultural waste with little intrinsic value banana stalk that can be converted to biofuels via hydrothermal carbonization however to make biomass to biofuel conversions economically viable we must identify value added products to add to the biorefinery such as materials for water treatment both the resulting hydrochar and raw biomass were biotemplated with zinc acetate to yield zno nanostructures with surface areas similar to 20 m(2) g( 1) the zincite particles were able to degrade a model organic dye (methylene blue) from aqueous solution though both the raw biomass and hydrochar yielded particles with similar surface areas the photocatalytic activity of the raw templated particles was superior we believe this is due to a higher concentration of calcium (naturally present in the banana biomass) in the hydrochar relative to the raw biomass the calcium produced calcite crystals in the biotemplated materials which may hinder the zno photocatalytic activity however the cao may be useful for removing heavy metals from water and catalyzing biofuel production ,0

molecular level insight into the interactions of dna with phospholipid bilayers barriers and triggers interactions of nuclear acids with cell membranes are at the heart of numerous biomedical and nanotechnological applications of dna and dna based nanodevices despite enormous recent development in dna nanotechnology very little is known about dna membrane interactions at a molecular level here we employ biased atomic scale computer simulations to calculate for the first time the free energy profile for partitioning a dna molecule into a phospholipid bilayer a system that is routinely used to mimic the properties of cell membranes our findings clearly show that a zwitterionic lipid bilayer represents a repulsive barrier for dna the potential of the mean force profile does not develop any local minima upon moving dna from water into the lipid water interface this energetic barrier can be overcome e g via adsorption of divalent calcium ions on the surface of a lipid bilayer which makes the lipid bilayer effectively cationic indeed our biased molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the corresponding free energy profile for partitioning dna into a lipid bilayer with adsorbed ca ions is characterized by a deep minimum therefore the bilayer bound calcium ions can serve as a trigger of the electrostatic attraction between dna and zwitterionic phospholipids in addition we performed a series of unbiased computer simulations for lipid bilayers with absorbed calcium ions and showed that the initial dna binding is driven by an overall positive charge of the bilayer while dna is stabilized on the bilayer surface by ca ions that laterally diffuse towards dna to form tight bridges between phosphate groups of dna and lipids overall our computational findings contribute to a long standing problem of interactions of charged nano objects (such as dna and dna base nanostructures) with cell membranes ,0

mobility enhancing coatings for vitreoretinal surgical devices hydrophilic and enzymatic coatings investigated by microrheology ophthalmic wireless microrobots are proposed for minimally invasive vitreoretinal surgery devices in the vitreous experience nonlinear mobility as a result of the complex mechanical properties of the vitreous and its interaction with the devices a microdevice that will minimize its interaction with the macromolecules of the vitreous (i e mainly hyaluronan (ha) and collagen) can be utilized for ophthalmic surgeries although a few studies on the interactions between the vitreous and microdevices exist there is no literature on the influence of coatings on these interactions this paper presents how coatings on devices affect mobility in the vitreous surgical catheters in the vasculature use hydrophilic polymer coatings that reduce biomolecular absorption and enhance mobility in this work such polymers polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) polyethylene glycol (peg) and ha coatings were utilized and their effects on mobility in the vitreous were characterized hydrophilic titanium dioxide (tio2) coating was also developed and characterized collagenase and hyaluronidase enzymes were coated on probes' surfaces with a view to enhancing their mobility by enzymatic digestion of the collagen and ha of the vitreous respectively to model the human vitreous ex vivo porcine vitreous and collagen were used for studying the effects of hyaluronidase the vitreous and ha were used the hydrophilic and enzymatic coatings were characterized by oscillatory magnetic microrheology the statistical significance of the mean relative displacements (i e mobility) of the coated probes with respect to control probes was assessed all studied hydrophilic coatings improve mobility except for ha which decreases mobility potentially due to bonding with vitreal macromolecules tio2 coating improves mobility in collagen by 28 3 and in the vitreous by 15 4 peg and pvp coatings improve mobility in collagen by 19 4 and by 39 6 respectively but their improvement in the vitreous is insignificant at a 95 confidence level (cl) ha coating affects mobility by reducing it in collagen by 35 6 (statistically significant) and in the vitreous by 16 8 (insignificant change at 95 cl) the coatings cause similar effects in collagen and in the vitreous however the effects are lower in the vitreous which can be due to a lower concentration of collagen in the vitreous than in the prepared collagen samples the coatings based on enzymatic activity increase mobility (i e 40 after 15 min experiments in the vitreous models) more than the hydrophilic coatings based on physicochemical interactions however the enzymes have time dependent effects and they dissolve from the probe surface with time the presented results are useful for researchers and companies developing ophthalmic devices they also pave the way to understanding how to adjust mobility of a microdevice in a complex fluid by choice of an appropriate coating ,1
uniform incorporation of flocculent molybdenum disulfide nanostructure into three dimensional porous graphene as an anode for high performance lithium ion batteries and hybrid supercapacitors hybrid supercapacitors (hscs) with lithium ion battery type anodes and electric double layer capacitor type cathodes are attracting extensive attention and under wide investigation because of their combined merits of both high power and energy density however the performance of most hscs is limited by low kinetics of the battery type anode which cannot match the fast kinetics of the capacitor type cathode in this study we have synthesized a three dimensional (3d) porous composite with uniformly incorporated mos2 flocculent nanostructure onto 3d graphene via a facile solution processed method as an anode for high performance hscs this composite shows significantly enhanced electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effects of the conductive graphene sheets and the interconnected porous structure which exhibits a high rate capability of 688 mah g even at a high current density of 8 a g and a stable cycling performance (997 mah g after 700 cycles at 2 a g) furthermore by using this composite as the anode for hscs the hsc shows a high energy density of 156 wh kg at 197 w kg which also remains at 97 wh kg even at a high power density of 8314 w kg with a stable cycling life among the best results of the reported hscs thus far ,1
modeling of band 3 protein diffusion in the normal and defective red blood cell membrane we employ a two component red blood cell (rbc) membrane model to simulate lateral diffusion of band 3 proteins in the normal rbc and in the rbc with defective membrane proteins the defects reduce the connectivity between the lipid bilayer and the membrane skeleton (vertical connectivity) or the connectivity of the membrane skeleton itself (horizontal connectivity) and are associated with the blood disorders of hereditary spherocytosis (hs) and hereditary elliptocytosis (he) respectively initially we demonstrate that the cytoskeleton limits band 3 lateral mobility by measuring the band 3 macroscopic diffusion coefficients in the normal rbc membrane and in a lipid bilayer without the cytoskeleton then we study band 3 diffusion in the defective rbc membrane and quantify the relation between band 3 diffusion coefficients and percentage of protein defects in he rbcs in addition we illustrate that at low spectrin network connectivity (horizontal connectivity) band 3 subdiffusion can be approximated as anomalous diffusion while at high horizontal connectivity band 3 diffusion is characterized as confined diffusion our simulations show that the band 3 anomalous diffusion exponent depends on the percentage of protein defects in the membrane cytoskeleton we also confirm that the introduction of attraction between the lipid bilayer and the spectrin network reduces band 3 diffusion but we show that this reduction is lower than predicted by the percolation theory furthermore we predict that the attractive force between the spectrin filament and the lipid bilayer is at least 20 times smaller than the binding forces at band 3 and glycophorin c the two major membrane binding sites finally we explore diffusion of band 3 particles in the rbc membrane with defects related to vertical connectivity we demonstrate that in this case band 3 diffusion can be approximated as confined diffusion for all attraction levels between the spectrin network and the lipid bilayer by comparing the diffusion coefficients measured in horizontal vs vertical defects we conclude that band 3 mobility is primarily controlled by the horizontal connectivity ,1
effects of molecular mass of polymer and composition on the compressive properties of hydrogels composed of laponite and sodium polyacrylate recent studies have shown that hydrogels prepared by simple mixing of a polyelectrolyte (sodium polyacrylate (paas)) and clay (laponite) with a dispersant (tetrasodium pyrophosphate) are mechanically tough in this study the mechanical and structural properties of such hydrogels were investigated in detail as a function of both the molecular mass of the polymers and the hydrogel composition by means of compression measurements and synchrotron small angle x ray scattering analysis to clarify the origin of the mechanical toughness the hydrogels prepared under optimum conditions were not broken even after 90 compression the elastic moduli of the hydrogels gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of paas whereas they reached a maximum with respect to the concentration variation of the dispersant the gels prepared at the compositions where the modulus was maximal were mechanically tough these composition dependencies of the mechanical properties were related to structural inhomogeneity in the gel thus the results of this study demonstrate that inhomogeneity substantially lowers the mechanical properties of these hydrogels at high clay concentrations the elastic moduli of the hydrogels were not affected by the molecular mass of paas in contrast at low clay concentrations they substantially decreased with decreasing the molecular mass of paas the results of this study reveal that paas with a molecular mass greater than similar to 10(6) is necessary for fabricating the mechanically tough hydrogels (c) 2016 elsevier b v all rights reserved ,1

molecular architecture requirements for polymer grafted lignin superplasticizers superplasticizers are a class of anionic polymer dispersants used to inhibit aggregation in hydraulic cement lowering the yield stress of cement pastes to improve workability and reduce water requirements the plant derived biopolymer lignin is commonly used as a low cost low performance plasticizer but attempts to improve its effects on cement rheology through copolymerization with synthetic monomers have not led to significant improvements here we demonstrate that kraft lignin can form the basis for high performance superplasticizers in hydraulic cement but the molecular architecture must be based on a lignin core with a synthetic polymer corona that can be produced via controlled radical polymerization using slump tests of ordinary portland cement pastes we show that polyacrylamidegrafted lignin prepared via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization can reduce the yield stress of cement paste to similar levels as a leading commercial polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer at concentrations ten fold lower although the lignin material produced via controlled radical polymerization does not appear to reduce the dynamic viscosity of cement paste as effectively as the polycarboxylate superplasticizer despite having a similar affinity for the individual mineral components of ordinary portland cement in contrast polyacrylamide copolymerized with a methacrylated kraft lignin via conventional free radical polymerization having a similar overall composition did not reduce the yield stress or the viscosity of cement pastes while further work is required to elucidate the mechanism of this effect these results indicate that controlling the architecture of polymer grafted lignin can significantly enhance its performance as a superplasticizer for cement ,1

bimodal distribution of the magnetic dipole moment in nanoparticles with a monomodal distribution of the physical size high frequency applications of magnetic nanoparticles such as therapeutic hyperthermia and magnetic particle imaging are sensitive to nanoparticle size and dipole moment usually it is assumed that magnetic nanoparticles with a log normal distribution of the physical size also have a log normal distribution of the magnetic dipole moment here we test this assumption for different types of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the 5 20 nm range by multimodal fitting of magnetization curves using the minorim inversion method the particles are studied while in dilute colloidal dispersion in a liquid thereby preventing hysteresis and diminishing the effects of magnetic anisotropy on the interpretation of the magnetization curves for two different types of well crystallized particles the magnetic distribution is indeed log normal as expected from the physical size distribution however two other types of particles with twinning defects or inhomogeneous oxide phases are found to have a bimodal magnetic distribution our qualitative explanation is that relatively low fields are sufficient to begin aligning the particles in the liquid on the basis of their net dipole moment whereas higher fields are required to align the smaller domains or less magnetic phases inside the particles (c) 2014 elsevier b v all rights reserved ,1

specific methionine oxidation of cytochrome c in complexes with zwitterionic lipids by hydrogen peroxide potential implications for apoptosis cytochrome c (cyt c) has been previously shown to participate in cardiolipin (cl) oxidation and therefore in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization during the early events of apoptosis the gain in this function has been ascribed to specific cl cyt c interactions here we report that the cationic protein cyt c is also able to interact electrostatically with the main lipid components of the mitochondrial membranes the zwitterionic lipids phosphatidylcholine (pc) and phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) through the mediation of phosphate anions that bind specifically to amino groups in the surfaces of protein and model membranes in these complexes cyt c reacts efficiently with h2o2 at submillimolar levels which oxidizes the sulfur atom of the axial ligand met80 the modified protein is stable and presents significantly enhanced peroxidatic activity based on these results we postulate that the rise of h2o2 concentrations to the submillimolar levels registered during initiation of the apoptotic program may represent one signaling event that triggers the gain in peroxidatic function of the cyt c molecules bound to the abundant pe and pc membrane components as the activated protein is a chemically stable species it can potentially bind and oxidize important targets such as cl ,0

polymer treated bentonite clay for chemical resistant geosynthetic clay liners the purpose of hydraulic barriers such as geosynthetic clay liners (gcls) is to isolate waste liquids from the environment bentonite clay is widely used in gcls because of its elevated sealing capacity in the presence of water and its ability to restrict the migration of solutes (chemico osmotic efficiency or semi permeable membrane behaviour) however exposure to high concentrations of inorganic solutions can change the clay fabric increasing its hydraulic conductivity and degrading its membrane behaviour with a consequent harm to the environment the aim of this research was to study the hydraulic and chemico osmotic performance of amended clays for this purpose an engineered clay (hyper clay) was developed through treatment of a natural bentonite with an anionic polymer and the results were compared with two amended clay materials (multi swellable bentonite (msb) and a dense prehydrated gcl (dph gcl)) to demonstrate the potential benefits of polymer treatment material characterisation through x ray diffraction analysis density of solid particles atterberg limits and swelling tests was performed on treated and untreated samples subsequently hydraulic conductivity and chemico osmotic tests were performed with cacl2 solutions on treated and untreated clays to evaluate the modified clays resistance to chemical attack the results of this research showed that the present amendment technology has a great potential for future gcl applications x ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the intercalation of the polymer in the interlayer region of the clay inducing a dispersed clay structure the swell index and the liquid limit of the clay increased with increasing polymer dosage suggesting a potential benefit of the polymer on preserving the hydraulic performance of the clay unlike the untreated clay hyper clay treatment maintained low hydraulic conductivity of the clay to cacl2 even in the long term and protected the clay against the destructive role of diffusion maintaining the initial osmotic efficiency in the long term test results were also compared with other amended clays msb and dph gcl these two amended clay materials displayed a chemico osmotic behaviour at the steady state similar to that observed on untreated clay on the other hand the preservation of the chemico osmotic efficiency of the hyper clay with time suggests that the carboxymethyl cellulose was not flushed out during the long period of permeation with deionised water ,1

wrinkling dynamics of fluctuating vesicles in time dependent viscous flow we study the fully nonlinear nonlocal dynamics of two dimensional vesicles in a time dependent incompressible viscous flow at finite temperature we focus on a transient instability that can be observed when the direction of applied flow is suddenly reversed which induces compressive forces on the vesicle interface and small scale interface perturbations known as wrinkles develop these wrinkles are driven by regions of negative elastic tension on the membrane using a stochastic immersed boundary method with a biophysically motivated choice of thermal fluctuations we investigate the wrinkling dynamics numerically different from deterministic wrinkling dynamics thermal fluctuations lead to symmetry breaking wrinkling patterns by exciting higher order modes this leads to more rapid and more realistic wrinkling dynamics our results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data by kantsler et al kantsler et al phys rev lett 2007 99 17802 we compare the nonlinear simulation results with perturbation theory modified to account for thermal fluctuations the strength of the applied flow strongly influences the most unstable wavelength characterizing the wrinkles and there are significant differences between the results from perturbation theory and the fully nonlinear simulations which suggests that the perturbation theory misses important nonlinear interactions strikingly we find that thermal fluctuations actually have the ability to attenuate variability of the characteristic wavelength of wrinkling by exciting a wider range of modes than the deterministic case which makes the evolution less constrained and enables the most unstable wavelength to emerge more readily we further find that thermal noise helps prevent the vesicle from rotating if it is misaligned with the direction of the applied extensional flow ,1

theory of phase separation and polarization for pure ionic liquids room temperature ionic liquids are attractive to numerous applications and particularly to renewable energy devices as solvent free electrolytes they demonstrate a paramount connection between the material morphology and coulombic interactions the electrode rtil interface is believed to be a product of both polarization and spatiotemporal bulk properties yet theoretical studies have dealt almost exclusively with independent models of morphology and electrokinetics introduction of a distinct cahn hilliard poisson type mean field framework for pure molten salts (i e in the absence of any neutral component) allows a systematic coupling between morphological evolution and the electrokinetic phenomena such as transient currents specifically linear analysis shows that spatially periodic patterns form via a finite wavenumber instability and numerical simulations demonstrate that while labyrinthine type patterns develop in the bulk lamellar structures are favored near charged surfaces the results demonstrate a qualitative phenomenology that is observed empirically and thus provide a physically consistent methodology to incorporate phase separation properties into an electrochemical framework ,1
novel aramid nanofiber coated polypropylene separators for lithium ion batteries aramid nanofiber (anf) coated separators were successfully prepared by the dip coating of a cationized polypropylene (pp) porous separator in an anf dispersion in dmso the anfs were successfully coated onto the surface of the cationized pp separator as demonstrated by ft ir and xps measurements and the anfs could be directly observed on the surface of the composite separator via sem and afm the anf based coating layers became more uniform and denser as more dip coating cycles were employed the gas permeabilities of the separators were strongly influenced by the concentrations of the anf dispersion and the number of dip coating cycles the porosity decreased and a narrower pore size distribution was obtained after the anfs were coated onto the cationized pp separator the anf coated separators were found to exhibit higher dimensional stabilities than the pristine pp separator the separators exhibited almost identical endothermic peaks in the dsc experiment and a similar shrink temperature in the dma experiment but the anf coated separator exhibited a higher rupture temperature the anf coated separator retained a comparable mechanical strength with that of the pristine pp separator the anf coating layer was mechanically stable and durable in the electrolyte the anf coated separator exhibited comparable c rate performance and cycling performance in lmo li cell systems to that of the pda pp separator and showed significantly better c rate performance and cycling performance than that of the pristine pp separator the anf coated pp separators exhibited improved safety in a hot oven test in comparison with the pristine pp separator thus the anf coated separators have great potential for use in lithium ion batteries ,1
an investigation into the nano micro architecture of electrospun poly (epsilon caprolactone) and self assembling peptide fibers self assembling peptides (saps) have the ability to spontaneously assemble into ordered nanostructures enabling the manufacture of 'designer' nanomaterials the reversible molecular association of saps has been shown to offer great promise in therapeutics via for example the design of biomimetic assemblies for hard tissue regeneration this could be further exploited for novel nano micro diagnostic tools however self assembled peptide gels are often associated with inherent weak and transient mechanical properties their incorporation into polymeric matrices has been considered as a potential strategy to enhance their mechanical stability this study focuses on the incorporation of an 11 residue peptide p 11 8 (peptide sequence ch3co gln gln arg phe orn trp orn phe glu gln gln nh2) within a fibrous scaffold of poly (epsilon caprolactone) (pcl) in this study an electrospinning technique was used to fabricate a biomimetic porous scaffold out of a solution of p 11 8 and pcl which resulted in a biphasic structure composed of submicron fibers (diameter of 100 700 nm) and nanofibers (diameter of 10 100 nm) the internal morphology of the fabric and its micro structure can be easily controlled by changing the peptide concentration the secondary conformation of p 11 8 was investigated in the as spun fibers by atr ftir spectroscopy and it is shown that peptide self assembly into beta sheet tapes has taken place during fiber formation and the deposition of the fibrous web ,1
using a biomimetic membrane surface experiment to investigate the activity of the magnetite biomineralisation protein mms6 magnetotactic bacteria are able to synthesise precise nanoparticles of the iron oxide magnetite within their cells these particles are formed in dedicated organelles termed magnetosomes these lipid membrane compartments use a range of biomineralisation proteins to nucleate and regulate the magnetite crystallisation process a key component is the membrane protein mms6 which binds to iron ions and helps to control the formation of the inorganic core we have previously used mms6 on gold surfaces patterned with a self assembled monolayer to successfully produce arrays of magnetic nanoparticles here we use this surface system as a mimic of the interior face of the magnetosome membrane to study differences between intact mms6 and the acid rich c terminal peptide subregion of the mms6 protein when immobilised on surfaces the peptide is unable to reproduce the particle size or homogeneity control exhibited by the full mms6 protein in our experimental setup moreover the peptide is unable to support anchoring of a dense array of nanoparticles to the surface this system also allows us to deconvolute particle binding from particle nucleation and shows that mms6 particle binding is less efficient when supplied with preformed magnetite nanoparticles when compared to particles precipitated from solution in the presence of the surface immobilised mms6 this suggests that mms6 binds to iron ions rather than to magnetite surfaces in our system and is perhaps a nucleating agent rather than a controller of magnetite crystal growth the comparison between the peptide and the protein under identical experimental conditions indicates that the full length sequence is required to support the full function of mms6 on surfaces ,0

synthetic transformations through alkynoxy palladium interactions and c h activation organic synthesis based on straightforward transformations is essential for environmentally benign manufacturing for the invention of novel pharmaceuticals agrochemicals and organoelectronic materials in order to ultimately realize a sustainable society metal catalyzed c h bond cleaving functionalization has become a promising method for achieving the above goal for site selective c h bond cleavage so called directing groups i e ligands attached to substrates are employed commonly utilized directing groups are carbonyls imines carboxyls amides and pyridyls which s donate electron pairs to metals on the other hand unsaturated substrates such as alkenes and alkynes which participate largely as reactants in organic synthesis are prepared readily by a wide variety of synthetic transformations and are also employed as reactants in organometallic chemistry moreover such unsaturated groups form complexes with some metals by ligation of their p orbitals via donation and back donation however the use of unsaturated bonds as directing groups has not been studied extensively we have been involved in the development of methods for the cleavage of c h bonds by means of transition metal catalysts to achieve new carboncarbon bond forming reactions and incidentally came to focus on the alkynoxy group ( oc equivalent to c ) which shows a ketene like resonance structure we expected the alkynoxy group to interact electrophilically with a low valent transition metal complex in order to cleave adjacent c h bonds in this account we summarize our recent achievements on c h activation based on interactions of palladium with the alkynoxy group in alkynyl aryl ethers the alkynoxy group plays two roles in the transformation as a directing group for adjacent c h bond activation and as an acceptor for the carbon and hydrogen fragments a typical example is palladium catalyzed ortho c h bond activation in alkynoxyarenes followed by sequential insertion annulation with internal alkynes and the alkynoxy group to produce 2 methylidene 2h 1 benzopyrans mechanistic studies have shown that the presence of both oxygen and alkynyl moieties is essential for selective ortho c h bond activation and subsequent annulation in addition to internal alkynes norbornene allenes isocyanates and ketenes produce the corresponding oxacycles it is worthy of note that benzoxadinones formed by the reaction with isocyanates exhibit solid state luminescence in addition 2 methylphenyl alkynyl ethers and 2 alkynoxybiaryls undergo intramolecular annulation at the benzylic gamma position and aryl d position via c h bond activation to give benzofurans and dibenzopyrans respectively the disclosed methods allow us to construct useful p conjugated systems in a straightforward manner ,0

effect of selective heparin desulfation on preservation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 bioactivity after thermal stress bone morphogenetic protein 2 (bmp 2) plays an important role in bone and cartilage formation and is of interest in regenerative medicine heparin can interact electrostatically with bmp 2 and thus has been explored for controlled release and potential stabilization of this growth factor in vivo however in its natively sulfated state heparin has potent anticoagulant properties that may limit its use desulfation reduces anticoagulant properties but may impact heparin's ability to interact and protect bmp 2 from denaturation the goal of this study was to characterize three selectively desulfated heparin species (n desulfated (hep( n)) 6 o n desulfated (hep( n) ( 6o)) and completely desulfated heparin (hep( )) and determine if the sulfation level of heparin affected the level of bmp 2 bioactivity after heat treatment at 65 degrees c bmp 2 bioactivity was evaluated using the established c2c12 cell assay the resulting alkaline phosphatase activity data demonstrated that native heparin maintained a significant amount of bmp 2 bioactivity and the effect appeared to be heparin concentration dependent although all three had the same molecular charge as determined by zeta potential measurements desulfated heparin derivatives hep( n) and hep( n) ( 6o)) were not as effective as native heparin in maintaining bmp 2 bioactivity (only similar to 35 of original activity remained in both cases) these findings can be used to better select desulfated heparin species that exhibit low anticoagulant activity while extending the half life of bmp 2 in solution and in delivery systems ,0

storage of renewable energy by reduction of co2 with hydrogen the main difference between the past energy economy during the industrialization period which was mainly based on mining of fossil fuels e g coal oil and methane and the future energy economy based on renewable energy is the requirement for storage of the energy fluxes renewable energy except biomass appears in time and location dependent energy fluxes as heat or electricity upon conversion storage and transport of energy requires a high energy density and has to be realized in a closed materials cycle the hydrogen cycle i e production of hydrogen from water by renewable energy storage and use of hydrogen in fuel cells combustion engines or turbines is a closed cycle however the hydrogen density in a storage system is limited to 20 mass and 150 kg m(3) which limits the energy density to about half of the energy density in fossil fuels introducing co into the cycle and storing hydrogen by the reduction of co to hydrocarbons allows renewable energy to be converted into synthetic fuels with the same energy density as fossil fuels the resulting cycle is a closed cycle (co2 neutral) if co is extracted from the atmosphere today's technology allows co to be reduced either by the sabatier reaction to methane by the reversed water gas shift reaction to co and further reduction of co by the fischer tropsch synthesis (fts) to hydrocarbons or over methanol to gasoline the overall process can only be realized on a very large scale because the large number of by products of fts requires the use of a refinery therefore a well controlled reaction to a specific product is required for the efficient conversion of renewable energy (electricity) into an easy to store liquid hydrocarbon (fuel) in order to realize a closed hydrocarbon cycle the two major challenges are to extract co from the atmosphere close to the thermodynamic limit and to reduce co2 with hydrogen in a controlled reaction to a specific hydrocarbon nanomaterials with nanopores and the unique surface structures of metallic clusters offer new opportunities for the production of synthetic fuels ,0

designing a new class of bases for nucleic acid quadruplexes and quadruplex active ligands a new class of quadruplex nucleobases derived from 3 deazaguanine has been designed for various applications as smart quadruplex ligands as well as quadruplex based aptamers receptors and sensors an efficient strategy for modifying the guanine quadruplex core has been developed and tested by using quantum chemistry methods several potential guanine derivatives modified at the 3 or 8 position or both are analyzed and the results compared to reference systems containing natural guanine analysis of the formation energies (blyp d3(bj) def2 tzvpp level of theory in combination with the cosmo model for water) in model systems consisting of two and three stacked tetrads with na k ion(s) inside the internal channel indicates that the formation of structures with 3 halo 3 deazaguanine bases leads to a substantial gain in energy as compared to the corresponding reference guanine complexes the results cast light on changes in the noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonding stacking and ion coordination) in a quadruplex stem upon modification of the guanine core in particular the enhanced stability of the modified quadruplexes was shown to originate mainly from increased stacking our study suggests the 3 halo 3 deazaguanine skeleton as a potential building unit for quadruplex systems and smart g quadruplex ligands ,0
